## Support

We know you'll need some help when working with Fluent NHibernate, don't be shy (we won't judge!). There are a few options available for you, but it's up to you which one you feel suits your needs the best.

<blockquote>If you raised questions on our <a href="http://support.fluentnhibernate.org">Support Desk</a>, they will continue to be answered; however, we will be discontinuing future support requests from that service. Please see the alternative options listed below.</blockquote> 

### Read the wiki

The first port of call should be the [wiki](http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org). We've put a fair amount of time into the wiki, and it should be a good starting point for you. There's a [getting started guide](http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Getting_started), as well as details about our [fluent mappings](http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Fluent_mapping), [auto mappings](http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Auto_mapping), and [conventions](http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Conventions).

If you can't find what you need on there, please let us know on the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate) and we'll do our best to update the wiki.

### Ask a Question on StackOverflow

[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) is a great community for developers, and we want to leverage that community to help you with your Fluent NHibernate questions. There's a great deal of NHibernate and Fluent NHibernate users on StackOverflow (including our team!).

Have a read of the [StackOverflow FAQ](http://stackoverflow.com/faq) if you're unfamiliar with the site.

Make sure to search for your question first, because someone may have asked before you; if you do ask a question, tag it [fluent-nhibernate](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fluent-nhibernate) and (optionally) [nhibernate](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nhibernate) so people can find it easily.

We look forward to seeing you there, and gaining reputation answering your questions!

### Use our Mailing List

If you have a suggestion or just want to get ahold of the developers - you can use our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/fluent-nhibernate). You won't get responses as quickly as on StackOverflow, as you'll only be talking to a smaller user-base, but it's your direct line to the developers.

### Commercial Support

Open source projects are built and maintained by the community and a core contingent of dedicated developers; however, very rarely is it their primary job to contribute to said projects, and ultimately the Real World and paid work can get in the way of front-line support.

If there's a feature you *need* implementing, a bug that you *cannot* work around, or simply an *urgent* troubleshooting issue, then commercial support can be an effective way to remedy your situation.

The Fluent NHibernate project lead, <a href="http://jagregory.com">James Gregory</a>, offers commercial support through his company: <a href="http://proofisgood.com">Proof of Concept</a>. Pricing is on a case-by-case basis, please contact him directly at <a href="mailto:james@proofisgood.com">james@proofisgood.com</a> for further information or a quotation.
