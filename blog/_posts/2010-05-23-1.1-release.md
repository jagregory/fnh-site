title: Fluent NHibernate 1.1 Released
author: James Gregory
---

It's been a long time coming, but here it is: [Fluent NHibernate 1.1](/downloads/releases/fluentnhibernate-1.1.zip).

The primary purpose of this release is to get everyone up-to-date and off the master branch. It comprises of over 200 commits, many bugfixes, and several new features.

You can read the release notes over on the wiki: [1.1 release notes](http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Release_notes_1.1), and an [upgrade guide from 1.0RTM](http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Release_1.1_upgrade_guide).

I've put together a few posts highlighting a few of the new features that've been slipped into this release.

* [Automapping Configuration](/blog/2010/05/23/feature-focus-automapping.html)
* [Field support](/blog/2010/05/23/feature-focus-fields.html)
* [ComponentMap](/blog/2010/05/23/feature-focus-componentmap.html)

In keeping with our dependency policy, we've upgraded to the latest NHibernate release (2.1.2GA). Support for 3.0 will be added when a GA is available.

I'd like to personally thank the Fluent NHibernate team for all their hard work, as well as the huge ammount of community support we've received. Make sure to check out the [front page](http://fluentnhibernate.org) of the Fluent NHibernate website to see the full list of people who've contributed.
