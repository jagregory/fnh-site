Fluent NHibernate 1.2 released

It's been a long time coming. Fluent NHibernate 1.2 is now officially released. You can download it from the [website downloads page](http://fluentnhibernate.org/downloads).

The bulk of changes are bugfixes, but we've also upgraded to NHibernate 3.1. There's a few fancy things around [access strategies](http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Fluent_mapping#Access_strategies) and [IEnumerable's](http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Fluent_mapping#Collection_types), and some [diagnostics](https://github.com/jagregory/fluent-nhibernate/commit/8c7ad8d3887d7c5146a8982e06e9062986bf15e4) thrown in for good measure. For everything else, you can read the [release notes](http://wiki.fluentnhibernate.org/Release_notes_1.2).

This will hopefully be the last release of our 1.x code path, which will give us plenty of time to work on some shiny features for 2.0.
